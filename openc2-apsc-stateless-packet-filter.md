## Abstract
Cyberattacks are increasingly sophisticated, less expensive to execute, dynamic and automated. The provision of cyberdefense via statically configured products operating in isolation is no longer tenable. Standardized interfaces, protocols and data models will facilitate the integration of the functional blocks within a system or enterprise. Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable the command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation. The motivation behind OpenC2 was to enable command and control of cyber defense and recognizes that a language such as OpenC2 is necessary but insufficient to enable coordinated cyber response. Other aspects of coordinated cyber response such as sensing, analytics, and selecting appropriate courses of action are beyond the scope of OpenC2.

# 1 Introduction
A firewall is a network security function that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules.  Current firewalls are characterized as:

1. Stateful packet inspection (or "traditional") - allows or blocks traffic based on connection state, port and protocol
2. Unified threat management (UTM) - performs stateful packet inspection functions plus intrusion prevention, anti-virus, and potentially other services
3. Next-generation firewall (NGFW) - performs stateful packet inspection functions plus intrusion prevention, application awareness, external information feeds, and adaptability to future threats. [1], [2], [3]

Firewalls are generally categorized as network-based or host-based and can take many forms, from dedicated appliances or as part of a multi-function security appliance, to software that runs on general-purpose physical hosts or virtual networks.  This actuator profile applies to stateful packet inspection functions.  Additional functions performed by UTM and NGFW products are covered in separate profiles.

This actuator profile specifies the set of actions, targets, specifiers, and options that integrates firewall functionality with the Open Command and Control (OpenC2) command set. Through this command set, cyber security orchestrators may gain visibility and provide control into the firewall functionality in a manner that is independent of the vendor or generator of the firewall. In the context of this document, 'firewall' refers to the first generation packet filter firewalls. Next generation firewall products that provide additional functionality are referred to other actuator profiles. NEED TO DEFINE

## 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to:

* Identify the OpenC2 ACTIONS that are applicable to the actuators with firewall functionality.
* Identify the TARGETS that are applicable to the firewall class of actuators.
* Identify ACTUATOR SPECIFIERS and OPTIONS that are applicable and/or unique to the firewall class of actuators
* Identify the COMMAND OPTIONS that are applicable to firewall actuators
* Provide sample OpenC2 commands to a firewall

All components, devices and systems that provide firewall functionality will implement the ACTIONS, TARGETS, SPECIFIERS and OPTIONS identified as minimum to implement (MTI) in this document. Actions that are applicable, but not necessarily required for firewalls will be identified as optional.

## 1.2 Scope
Actuator profiles will provide mandatory to implement and optional actions for a cyber defense function. The profiles will be used for the purposes of validation and interoperability.

Actuator profiles will use as much information from the OpenC2 Language Specification as possible, including vocabularies for action types, target types specifiers and options, actuator types, and command options.

The possible action target pairings will be called out in the actuator profiles

Actuator Profiles:

* MUST NOT define or implement ACTIONS external to this specification.
* Are specifications that SHALL have a normative reference to the OpenC2 Language Specification
* Reference ACTIONS and OPTIONS that MUST be a subset of the ACTIONS and OPTIONS defined in Section X.X of this specification.
* MUST define the mandatory to implement ACTIONS and OPTIONS.
* MAY define optional ACTIONS and OPTIONS.
* MUST define the applicable TARGETS utilizing the target data model provided in Section X.X of this specification.
* MAY define required actuator 'specifiers' as defined in Section X.X of this specification.
* MAY define required actuator 'options' as defined in Section X.X of this specification.
* MAY define optional actuator 'specifiers' and 'options' as defined in Section
* MAY define an actuator specific TARGET data model.

Figure 1 presents a notional OpenC2 implementation which illustrates cases were a firewall profile may be required and the components within the network that may interact with or be affected by OpenC2.

* OpenC2 Message Fabric: The transport mechanism for passing OpenC2 commands between OpenC2 compliant entities within the network.
* Orchestrator: Products that send commands, receives responses, and manages the execution of a course of action involving one or more actuators. The orchestrator needs a priori knowledge of which commands the actuator can process and execute therefore must implement the profiles for any device that it intends to command.
* OpenC2 Proxy: An abstraction of the firewall functionality that maps (or translates) OpenC2 commands to an appropriate API (i.e., a mitigation manager or vendor API).
* Device Manager: Interfaces with one or more physical or virtual firewalls. A device manager is a means to provide mitigation system management, which includes participation in OpenC2 workflow processing, transforming actions into a format suitable for a given device, set of devices or capability within a device that provides the firewall functionality. A proxy between the OpenC2 message fabric and the device manager may implement the firewall profile and map the commands to the device manager's API or the device manager itself may natively support OpenC2 at its API (thus removing the need for the proxy).
* Proxy to Physical or virtual firewalls. An OpenC2 proxy must implement the firewall profile and map the commands to the vendor API.
* Native OpenC2 support: In the future, there may be devices that natively support OpenC2, and will be required to implement the firewall profile.
* Other Actuators: A product may provide multiple cyber defense mechanisms including firewall functionality as a subset of its capabilities thus the firewall profile is (in addition to other profiles) needed.

# 2 OpenCLanguage Binding
The OpenC2 Language Specification (OpenC2 Forum, 2016) describes a vocabulary by which network elements may be commanded and controlled. By design, the language is intended to convey high level actions so that the desired effects of a command can be communicated despite a lack of detailed knowledge of the cyber defense components. As additional information is made available, the language is extensible with context specific specifiers and options which permits additional granularity of the command.

This section defines the set of ACTIONS, TARGETS, and OPTIONS that are meaningful in the context of the actuator in question. This section also describes the format of the RESPONSE frame's status and results field.

* The ACTIONS and OPTIONS defined in this section of the actuator profile MUST be a subset of the ACTIONS and OPTIONS defined in the OpenC2 Language specification. The actuator profiles MAY NOT define ACTIONS and OPTIONS that are external to OpenC2.
* This of the actuator profile MAY augment the definition of the actions and modifiers in the context of the actuator but MUST NOT define the actions and modifiers in a manner that is inconsistent with this specification.
* The actuator profiles MUST define the set of ACTIONS that are mandatory to implement.
* The actuator profiles MAY define the set of ACTIONS that are optional to implement.
* The actuator profile MUST identify the OpenC2 TARGETs and target-specifiers that are meaningful in the context of the actuator in question.
* The actuator profile SHOULD include a data model for the TARGETs and target-specifiers in accordance with the schema defined in this specification.
* The actuator profile SHOULD NOT define target-specifiers that are unique to the actuator profile.

## 2.1 Commands
### 2.1.1 Actions
The OpenC2 Language Specification (OpenC2 Forum, 2016) describes a vocabulary by which network elements may be commanded and controlled. By design, the language is intended to convey high level actions so that the desired effects of a command can be communicated despite a lack of detailed knowledge of the cyber defense components. As additional information is made available, the language is extensible with context specific modifiers and specifiers which permits additional granularity of the command.

OpenC2 actions are persistent in firewalls unless they are explicitly identified as running or temporary through the use of modifiers. See Table 1.

**Table 1. Firewall Actions**

| Action | Description | MTI |
|:---|:---|:---|
| query | The query action initiates a single request for information. Used to determine the state or settings of the firewall.  | MTI |
| deny | The deny action is used to prevent a traffic from reaching a destination or preventing access. | MTI |
| allow | The allow action permits traffic or access. | MTI |
| set | The set action changes a value within a configuration, a setting or some other value | MTI |
| notify | The notify action is used to direct an entity to send alerts to another entity. Notify is not used for normal operations, but is required for the use case where you need to rapidly direct the firewall to send alerts. | MTI |
| update | The update action instructs the component to retrieve and process a software update, reconfiguration, or some other update. | MTI |
| delete | Removes data, files and or entries. | MTI |
| save | Commits data or state to memory. | MTI |
| start | The start action initiates a process, application, system or some other activity. | Optional |
| stop | The stop action halts a system or ends an activity. | Optional |
| restart | The restart action conducts a stop of a system or an activity followed by a start. | Optional |
| redirect | In the context of a firewall, redirect is used to forward the packet, traffic or flow to another actuator or honey net and not necessarily to induce an alternate path to the destination. | Optional |

### 2.1.2 Targets
The TARGET is the object of the ACTION (or alternatively, the ACTION is performed on the TARGET). This document will use the OpenC2 schema which was derived from the STIX data model for cyber observables. Table 2 lists the TARGETs that are applicable to firewall functionality.

**Table 2. Target Data Model Applicable to Firewalls**

| Target | Description/Notes | Applicable Actions | MTI |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| domain-name | Fully qualified domain name. Supported by some firewalls. The actual rule within the firewall will be an IP address so the DNS resolution must take place. Most firewall implementations utilize tools that are optimized for DNS resolution. | deny, allow | Opt |
| Five-tuple | Consists of the address (source and destination), port number (source and destination) and protocol identifier. An 'incomplete' five-tuple may be sent to the firewall and it is left to the implementer's discretion with respect to the default value of the unspecified fields and/or if the unspecified fields make sense in the context of the device. | deny, allow | MTI |
| CIDR | In the interest of generating a more concise command, the use of the classless inter-domain routing notation to specific multiple addresses within the five-tuple is permitted. | deny, allow | Opt |
| Hostname | Supported by some firewalls. The actual rule within the firewall is an IP address so the hostname resolution must take place. | deny, allow | Opt |
| File | Typically supported by device managers but may be supported by some firewalls. The file object includes the path and name specifiers | Update | Opt |
| x-config | The x-config.fw object identifies configurable attributes of the firewall. The attributes include:<br><NOT_PARA> | Set | Opt |

### 2.1.3 Modifiers
Modifiers provide additional information about the action such as time, periodicity, duration, location etc. Modifiers can denote the when, where, and how aspects of an action. Modifiers can be used to indicate whether the actuator should explicitly acknowledge receipt of the command, respond upon completion of the execution of the command, or provide some other status information. OpenC2 actions are persistent (or permanent) in their implementations. Running, non-persistent or temporary commands can be achieved through the use of modifiers.

There are two types of Action Modifiers:

* Universal â Applicable to all actions for all actuators. The universal modifiers are documented in the Language Description document and by definition apply actuators that provide firewall function.
* Action Specific â Applicable to specific actions for all actuators.
* Actuator Specific; Are only meaningful in the context of a particular actuator function.

Table 3 summarizes the Modifiers as they relate to firewall functionality.

**Table 3. Firewall Functionality Modifiers**

| Modifier | Type | Description | Applicable Actions | MTI |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| id | string | The unique identifier for the action. | Universal | MTI |
| response | string | Indicate the type of response required for the action. | Universal | MTI |
| start-time | datetime | The specific date/time to initiate the action. | Universal | MTI |
| end-time | datetime | The specific date/time to end the action. | Universal | MTI |
| destination | string | Identifies where to send an acknowledgement or other response. | Universal | MTI |

## 2.2 Responses and Alerts
Response and Alerts messages originate from the actuator and are informative rather than a command or request that the recipient execute some task(s).

Alert is used to signal the occurrence of an event and are unsolicited. Response is used to provide any data requested as a result of an action such as acknowledgement, providing the status, or additional information related to the requested action. The recipient of the response can be the original requester of the action or to another recipient(s) designated in the modifier of the action.

Status codes apply to all actions and are presented in Table 4. The formats and what is expected in the response and alerts for specific actions will be captured when the specifiers for the various actions are defined in section 2.3 and examples will be provided in section 3. Responses and Alerts associated with MTI actions MUST be implemented. Implementations that include optional actions MUST implement the Responses associated with the implemented action.

**Table 4. Response Codes Applicable to All Actions**

| Status Code | Status Text | MTI |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 102 | Processing. Command received but action not necessarily complete | MTI |
| 200 | OK | MTI |
| 301 | Cannot execute, redirect to another entity. In this response code, a specifier that indicates a suggested entity MUST be included in the data field. | Optional |
| 400 | Unable to process command, parsing error | MTI |
| 401 | Authentication or authorization failure | MTI |
| 403 | Forbidden | MTI |
| 500 | Server Error | MTI |
| 501 | Not implemented | MTI |

# 3 Actuator Data Model
This section defines the data model for the profile. The ACTUATOR field within an OpenC2 message command is identified with the actuator profile, and this section defines the actuator-specifiers and actuator-options needed for additional precision.

* The specifiers provide information with respect to a particular actuator to increasing levels of precision.
* Actuator-options provide information with respect to how the actuator is to execute the action.
* The actuator profile MUST define a schema that includes specifiers and options that are meaningful in the context of the actuator.
* The actuator profile MUST define the parts of the schema that are mandatory to implement.
* The actuator profile MUST provide property tables which are derived from the schema. The property tables are normative and define the mandatory to implement and optional actuator-specifiers and actuator-options.

## 3.1 Actuator Specifiers
An ACTUATOR is the entity that provides the functionality and performs the action. The ACTUATOR executes the ACTION on the TARGET. In the context of this profile, the actuator is the firewall and the presence of one or more specifiers further refine which actuator(s) shall execute the action.

The ACTUATOR is optional in an OpenC2 command. If absent, then any entity that can execute the action should execute the command. If the ACTUATOR field is specified, then only the entities identified to the degree specified in the actuator field act upon the command.

Whether or not an actuator specifier is meaningful in the context of a firewall is strongly dependent on the individual product, therefore are optional.

Table 5 identifies the specifiers that are applicable to the firewall actuator. Section 3 provides sample commands with the use of specifiers.

**Table 5. Firewall Specifiers**

| Firewall Specifier | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Network | All network layer devices that implement the firewall profile |
| Perimeter | Perimeter; Firewalls with connections to the network and to external networks that maintain external routing tables |
| Internal | Internal; Firewalls that are not directly connected to devices external to the network. |
| Host | Hostname for a particular w/ firewall functionality |
| Ip-addr | Ip address for a particular w/ firewall functionality |
| Swid | Further specifies the Software ID for a particular device w/ firewall functionality |
| Named Group | User defined collection of devices with firewall functionality |

## 3.2 Actuator Options
There are actuator options that only apply to a subset of firewall actions. These options provide detail on how the action is executed. See Table 6.

**Table 6. Action Specific Firewall Actuator Options**

| Specifier | Type | Description | Applicable Actions | MTI |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Drop | Boolean | Stop processing and do not send a notification to the source of the packet. | Deny | MTI |
| Reject | Boolean | Stop processing and send a notification to the source of the packet. | Deny | MTI |
| Complete | Boolean | Stop processing and send a false acknowledgment to the source that the processing was completed. | Deny | Optional |
| Running | Boolean | Any changes to a device are to be implemented as persistent changes. Setting the running modifier to TRUE results in a command that is not persistent in the event of a reboot or restart. The running modifier can be overridden by issuing a subsequent _save_ action | Set, update | Optional |

 

# 4 Applicable OpenC2 COMMANDS
<This section contains action â target pairs, including target specifiers and options that are applicable to the actuator. Actuator specifier and options are also laid out.>

This page intentionally left blank.

# 5 Conformance statements
Conformant implementations of OpenC2 Firewall Functions:

* MUST support OpenC2 commands, responses, and alerts as defined in Section 4.
* MUST implement JSON serialization of the commands, responses and alerts that are consistent with the syntax defined in the OpenC2 Language Specification.
* MAY implement any serialization that provides a one to one mapping of the data elements as defined in the abstract schema presented in the Language Specification to a format that is consistent with the syntax defined in Appendix B OpenC2 SCHEMA â FIREWALL FUNCTIONS.
* MUST implement the actuator data model as presented in the abstract schema presented in Section 3.

<Note: need to define "support" - behavior that must occur as a result of executing commands>

# Appendix A. Sample commands
This section will summarize and provide examples of OpenC2 commands as they pertain to firewalls. The sample commands will be encoded in verbose JSON, however other encodings are possible provided the command is validated against the schema presented in Appendix A. Examples of corresponding responses and/or alerts will be provided where appropriate.

The samples provided in this section are for illustrative purposes only and are not to be interpreted as operational examples for actual systems. Within the scope of this document, a # character indicates a comment, however it should be noted that OpenC2 itself does not support comments within a command.

## 7.1 Deny and Allow
Deny and allow are mandatory to implement and can be treated as mathematical complements of each other. Unless otherwise stated, the example targets, specifiers, modifiers and corresponding responses are applicable to both actions.

        {statuscode=200}
}
```

## 7.2 Set
Set is mandatory to implement and is intended for toggling of values or enabling capabilities or functions. This action is distinct from update in that set needs to select from the allowed values of target (artifact, file, process, user-account, windows-registry-key) and the allowed actuator types. Set is intended for more atomic modifications rather than a full replacement of a configuration. In the context of firewalls, set is intended to modify data that impacts the firewall itself and it is inappropriate to use set to modify the ACL. Modifications of the ACL should utilize the deny and allow actions.

## 7.3 Update
Update is mandatory to implement and is intended for the device to process new configuration files, software updates, patches, policy updates etc. The update action is a compound action in that all of the steps required for a successful update (such as download the new file, install the file, reboot etc.) are implied. In the context of configuration updates, update is distinct from set in that a set command will provide the new value within the command itself while an update command may provide the location of the new files which are retrieved out of band.

```
# instructs the firewalls to acquire a new configuration file. Note that all network based firewalls will install the new update because no particular firewall was identified. Host based firewalls will not act on this because network firewalls were identified as the actuator
